# 3. Triangle Quest

Write a Python program that for an integer `n` (1-9), given by user input, prints a numerical triangle of height *n-1*, like the one below:



```
1
22
333
4444
55555
...

```

For example:


* for n=`1`, the output is `""`
* for n=`3`, the output is `"1\n22"`
* for n=`4`, the output is `"1\n22\333"`
* for n=`6`, the output is `"1\n22\333\n4444\n55555"`
