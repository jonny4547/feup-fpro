# 2. The sum of the squares

Write a Python program that, given an integer with one digit `d` and another integer `num`, both provided by user input in that order, prints the sum of the squares of the digits of `num` greater than `d`.


For example:


* for d=`2` and num=`135`, the output is `34` (because of 3*3+5*5)
* for d=`3` and num=`135`, the output is `25` (because of 5*5)
* for d=`5` and num=`135`, the output is `0`
