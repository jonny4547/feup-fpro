# 3. Card game

We are going to develop and test a card game based on the module cards available [here at GitHub](https://github.com/fpro-feup/public/blob/master/recitas/12/cards.py). Study it as you will import it as a module and use the code in `cards.play()` as a starting point for your own code.


First, write an auxiliary Python function `card_value(card)` that, given a `card`, returns its value. The values of the cards correspond to their numerical value from 2-10, all face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count 10 and the Ace counts 11. If the suits are black (clubs and spades) the value of the card doubles. ðŸ‚¡ ðŸƒ‘


Then re-write a new Python function `play(seed)` that returns a string with the winners of the game (for example, `"P1 P4"`). The winners of each turn, the ones with the most valuable cards, earn one point, and the final winners are the ones with the maximum number of points. The `seed` must be used to initialize the pseudo-random number generator using [`random.seed(seed)`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.seed).


As in the `play()` example given in the module `cards`, the game goes as follows:


1. We deal a hand of 13 cards to each player *(already done in the imported module)*
2. Then a start player is chosen and the players take turns playing their cards *(done)*
3. The players will play random cards at each turn until their hands are empty *(done)*
4. The turn winner, or winners in case there's a draw, are computed using the value of their cards
5. The winner, or winners in case there's a draw, are computed in the end.
