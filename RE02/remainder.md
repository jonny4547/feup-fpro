# 5. Remainder

Use Spyder3 to write a program that determines what is the actual time (using `now` of class `datetime` from module `datetime`).


Given that an alarm is set up for **8 hours and 30 minutes** later, the program prints the time on display at the time of the alarm, using the format `"hh:mm"` (hours and minutes).


**Hint:** You my find useful the following piece of code:



```
import datetime
now = datetime.datetime.now()
h = now.hour
m = now.minute

```

**Hint:** To see the full documentation about the module `datetime` go to [docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/datetime.html)
