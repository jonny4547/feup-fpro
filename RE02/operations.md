# 4. Operations and operands

The formula for computing the final amount if one is earning compound interest is given on Wikipedia as:


$$$A=P(1+\frac{r}{n})^{nt}$$$


Use Spyder3 to write a program that replaces these letters with something a bit more human-readable and calculate the final amount ($$A$$) at the end of the second year, for some varying amounts of money ($$P$$), payment frequency ($$n$$) at realistic interest rates ($$r$$).


Please `round` the result for 3 digits.


For example: 


* for P = 1000, n = 2, and r = 1% the result is 1020.151
* for P = 650, n = 1 and r = -0.05% the result is 643.516
