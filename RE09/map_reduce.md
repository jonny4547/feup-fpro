# 2. Map-Reduce

Write a Python function `map_reduce(n1, n2)` whereby you create a collection of the square of the odd numbers between `n1` and `n2` ([n1, n2[) using `map()` and `filter()`. Then use `reduce()` to multiply if the [accumulated result](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_lambda.php) is smaller than 50 or add the numbers otherwise.


Have a look at `reduce()` from module `functools` ([Higher-order functions and operations on callable objects](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/functools.html#module-functools)).
