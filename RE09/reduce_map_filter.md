# 5. Map, Filter & Reduce

Write a function `reduce_map_filter(args)` that receives a collection of arguments called `args` and returns the result of processing `args`. This `args` can be either a list of integers or a tuple of type `(op, f, args)`, where `op` is an operator (`"map"`, `"filter"` or `"reduce"`), `f` is a function and `args` is again a list of integers or a tuple. Each function `f` must be applied in a chain according to the `op` operator.
