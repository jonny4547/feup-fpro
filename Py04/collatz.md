# The Collatz sequence

Write a Python function `collatz(n)` that returns a comma-separated string with the Collatz sequence. Starting by the positive integer `n`, the next term of the Collatz sequence is obtained from the previous by: (i) diving the previous term by 2, if the previous term is even; or (ii) multiplying the previous term by 3 and then summing 1, if the previous term is odd. The sequence ends when it reaches 1.


* for the number `n=3`, the result is the string `3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1`
* for the number `n=12`, the result is the string `12,6,3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1`
