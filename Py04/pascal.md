# Pascal's triangle

Write a Python function `pascal(n)` that, for a given integer `n`, returns a string with the first `n` rows of Pascal's triangle. Each row finishes by `"\n"` (newline) and each value is separated by a single space. The value at the $$i$$-th row and $$j$$-th column of the triangle is equal to $$i!/(j!\,(i-j)!)$$. Note that $$i$$ and $$j$$ start in zero. You may use math.factorial.


* for the number `n=3`, the result is the string `1\n1 1\n1 2 1`
* for the number `n=5`, the result is the string `1\n1 1\n1 2 1\n1 3 3 1\n1 4 6 4 1`
