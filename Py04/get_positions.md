# Get positions

Write a function `get_positions` that receives two arguments: `sentence` (a string) and `word_list` (a list with 3 strings).


The first argument contains 2 words that appear in the second argument concatenated with a single space in between.


The function returns a string with the position in the list of the first word and the position of the second word in the list, separated by a single space. When any of the words of the sentence are not in the list, the function returns the empty string. Positions start counting at zero.
