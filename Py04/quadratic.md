Define a function `solver(a, b, c)` that returns the solution to the quadratic formula of the type: ax²+bx+c=0. Return the result in the form of a list: empty list if no solution exists in ℝ, a list with one or two elements if one or two solutions exist, respectively; if there are two solutions, use ascending order.
