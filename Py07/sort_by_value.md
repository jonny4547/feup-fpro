# Sort by value

Write a Python function `sort_by_value(dict)` that, given a dictionary `dict` of colors (key is the color name and value is its hexadecimal value), returns a list of pairs ordered by the hexadecimal value. Note that it is not possible to sort a dictionary, only to get a representation of a dictionary that is sorted. 


For example:


* `sort_by_value({"Magenta":"#FF00FF", "Red": "#FF0000", "White":"#FFFFFF"})` returns the list: `[("Magenta", "#FF00FF"), ("Red", "#FF0000"), ("White", "#FFFFFF")]`
