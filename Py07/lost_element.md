# Lost element

Write a Python function `lost_element(s1, s2)` that, given two sets of integers `s1` and `s2` which are duplicates of each other except one element (that is one element from one of the sets is missing) returns that missing element.


* `lost_element([{1, 4, 5, 7, 9}, {4, 5, 7, 9})` returns `1` (`1` is missing from the second array)
* `lost_element({2, 3, 4, 5}, {2, 3, 4, 5, 6})` returns `6` (`6` is missing from first array)
