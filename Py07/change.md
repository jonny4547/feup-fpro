# Change

Write a Python function `change(money)` that converts a given amount of `money` (â‰¥ 0) into several Euro coins. Minimize the number of coins given.


The return value should be a dictionary specifying how many coins of each type should be given to the customer. The keys of the dictionary should correspond to each coin: from 0.01 (1 cent) all the way up to 2.00 (2 euros).


Using if-else is forbidden.
