# Pairs of complete strings

Write a Python function `complete_pairs(s1, s2)` that, given two sets `s1` and `s2`, of sizes *n* and *m* respectively, finds the pairs that are *complete strings* on concatenating each string from `s1` to each string from `s2` and returns those concatenated pairs as a set.


Two strings are said to be complete if on concatenation, they contain all the 26 letters of the English alphabet. For example, “abcdefghi” and “jklmnopqrstuvwxyz” are complete as they together have all characters from ‘a’ to ‘z’.
