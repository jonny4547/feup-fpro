# 2. Sum dictionaries

Write a Python function `sum_dicts(lst)` that receives a list `lst` of dictionaries, each one having a set of keys and corresponding integer values.


The function returns a single dictionary with all the keys available in the input dictionaries. Values associated with the same key are added up in the final dictionary.


For example, if `lst=[{'a': 5, 'b': 3}, {'a': 1, 'c': 0}]` then the result is `{'a': 6, 'b': 3, 'c': 0}`.
