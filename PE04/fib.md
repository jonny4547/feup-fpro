# 3. Fibonacci generator

Write a generator function `fib(start, end)` which generates the Fibonacci sequence of integer numbers starting at the i-th number `start >= 1` and finishing at the i-th number `end >= start`.


The numbers of the sequence are calculated using the following formula: the first two numbers of the sequence are equal to 1 and each consecutive number is the sum of the last two numbers.


For example, if `start=1` and `end=7` then the *yielded* sequence is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]`.
