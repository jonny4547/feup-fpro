# 3. Volumes

Write a Python script that asks the user for a shape and all necessary parameters, then prints the volume of the shape, rounded to 1 decimal place.


For example, if the user requests a cylinder, you must then ask for its radius and height. 


The possible requested shapes, the shape's parameters, and corresponding output are the following:




| Shape (`str`) | Parameters (`float`) | Output |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `"sphere"` | radius ($$r$$) | $$\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$$ |
| `"cylinder"` | radius ($$r$$), height ($$h$$) | $$\pi r^2h$$ |
| `"cone"` | radius ($$r$$), height ($$h$$) | $$\frac{1}{3}\pi r^2h$$ |
