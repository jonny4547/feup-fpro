# Looping Numbers

A number is called a *Looping Number* if all adjacent digits in it differ by 1. The difference between 9 and 0 is considered as 1. All single digit numbers are considered looping numbers.


Write a Python program that receives an integer `n`, provided by the user, and checks whether the number is a looping number or not. If the number is a looping number, print the message `Looping number`, otherwise print the message `Not a looping number`.


You can assume that all inputs are non-negative numbers.
