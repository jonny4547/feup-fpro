# Prime numbers

Write a Python program that outputs all the *prime numbers* within a closed interval of numbers between `lower` and `upper`, given by user input.


For example:


* for lower=2 and upper=23 the output is: `Prime numbers between 2 and 23 are: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23`
* for lower=5 and upper=27 the output is: `Prime numbers between 5 and 27 are: 5 7 11 13 17 19 23`
* for lower=-2 and upper=5 the output is: `Prime numbers between -2 and 5 are: 2 3 5`
