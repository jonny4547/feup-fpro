# Combinations

Write a Python function `C` that receives the number of objects to choose from `n`, the number of objects selected `r` and produces all combinations possible.


Remember the formula:


$$$C^n\_r = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$$$


Round the result to the *floor*, for example the floor of 8.4 is 8 and the floor of 5.7 is 5.Â 


You cannot use the `math` package.
