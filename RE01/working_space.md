# 2. Working space

Create a directory to hold your practical work by typing the commands:



```
cd ~       # go to your Home directory
mkdir fpro # make a directory named "fpro"
cd fpro    # go to the new directory

```

Then execute the command:



```
pwd

```

and finally, write a Python program that prints exactly the same output.
