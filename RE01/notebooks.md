# 5. Jupyter Notebooks

Again, use FPRO's public repositories. But this time, download the notebooks of the lectures:



```
cd ~/fpro    # just in case you're not there
git clone https://github.com/fpro-feup/notebooks.git

```

Launch `jupyter-notebook` and use a browser to visit the URL printed in the console. Now, browse your way to the first notebook, `01-introduction.ipynb`.


Run the *last* chunk of code ("Looking forward"). What was the output? Copy and paste the last line of the output.


**Hint:** If there is an error about missing packages, install them using `pip3 install nome_pacote`.


**Hint:** To kill the running Jupyter server, you may hit `Ctrl` + `C`.
