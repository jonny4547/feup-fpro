Get the Python code hello.py from FPRO's public repository at GitHub, available at https://github.com/fpro-feup/public, and save the file in your working space directory by using:



```
cd ~/fpro      # just in case you're not there
git clone https://github.com/fpro-feup/public.git

```
cd public/recitas/01    # change directory
ls -l hello.py          # list directory
python3 hello.py      # run the Python script
