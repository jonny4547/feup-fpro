# 4. Joining 2 numbers

Write a Python program that, given two numbers `n1` and `n2` provided by the user (each one in a different `input()` statement) produces a new number `result` by joining both of them, in the order they are given.


Converting the numbers into strings is forbidden.


For example: if the numbers given are `n1=23` and `n2=567`, the resulting number is `23567`
