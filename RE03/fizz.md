# 3. Fizz buzz

Write a Python program that “plays” a version of the known game *FizzBuzz* over a sequence of natural numbers, up to an integer `n` provided by the user.


The program should build and finally print a string result with each number in the sequence separated by a space. However:


* If the number is a multiple of 3, appends the word `"Fizz"` instead
* If the number is a multiple of 5, appends the word `"Buzz"` instead
* If the number is both a multiple of 3 and 5, nothing is done


For example: for `n=7`, the final string should be `1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7`
