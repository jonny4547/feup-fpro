# 1. Reverse integers

Write a Python program that, given an integer `num` by user input, computes its reverse (the number with the digits by the reverse order) and prints it.


You are not allowed to use string manipulation (for example string concatenation).


For example:


* for num=`766`, the output is `667`
* for num=`789`, the output is `987`
* for num=`45654`, the output is `45654`
