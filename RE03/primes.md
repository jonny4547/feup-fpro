# 2. Prime numbers

Write a Python program that takes an integer `num`, provided by the user, and outputs: `True` when `num` is a *prime number* and `False` otherwise.


A *prime number* (or a *prime*) is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers [[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number)].


For example for `num = 7` the output is `True`.
