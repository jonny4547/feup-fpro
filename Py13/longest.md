# Longest word in file

Write a Python function `longest(filename)` that given the string `filename` returns the longest word in the text file. Do not worry about the punctuation.


For example:


* Considering that exists in the current directory a file `shakespeare.txt` with the content of [shakespeare.txt](https://github.com/fpro-feup/public/tree/master/recitas/13/shakespeare.txt), then `longest("shakespeare.txt")` returns the string `"self-substantial"`
* Considering that exists in the current directory a file `monty.txt` with the content of [monty.txt](https://github.com/fpro-feup/public/tree/master/recitas/13/monty.txt), then `longest("monty.txt")` returns the string `"tree-sloths"`
