# Interleave files

Write a Python function `interleave(f1, f2)` to combine each line from the first file (`f1`) with the corresponding line in the second file (`f2`), while there's lines in both files.


For example:


* Considering that exists in the current directory a file `shakespeare.txt` with the content of [shakespeare.txt](https://github.com/fpro-feup/public/tree/master/recitas/13shakespeare.txt) and another file with the content of [monty.txt](https://github.com/fpro-feup/public/tree/master/recitas/monty.txt), then `interleave("monty.txt", "shakespeare.txt")` returns a string with the same content of [mixed.txt](https://github.com/fpro-feup/public/blob/master/recitas/13/mixed.txt).
