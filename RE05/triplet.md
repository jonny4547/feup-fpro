# 4. Zero-sum triplet

Given a tuple of size > 3, write a Python function `triplet(a_tuple)` that finds a triplet (a, b, c) such that their sum is zero (a + b + c = 0).


In case there is more than one triplet that sums up to zero, return the first occurrence. In case there are none, return an empty tuple, ().
