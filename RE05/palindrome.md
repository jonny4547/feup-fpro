# 3. Number of palindromes

Write a Python function `palindrome(a_string)` that receives a string and computes the number of palindromic substrings. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. Do not count the palindromic substrings with just one character and use the function `format()` to get the result as required.
