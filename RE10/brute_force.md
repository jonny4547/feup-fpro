# 3. Brute force

You want to break into a computer and have to try different passwords to see which ones work.


Write a function `brute_force(f, l)` that receives two arguments:


1. `f(login)`: a function that represents the login. This function receives a string `login` and returns a boolean.
2. `l`: a list of possible characters.


The function calculates the combinations of 3 characters and return a list of those combinations that break into the function.


You cannot use cycles, only comprehensions.
