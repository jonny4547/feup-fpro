# 4. Generate multiples of 7

Write a **generator** function `multiples_of7(n)` which can iterate the numbers, which are divisible by 7, in the interval [0, n[.


Remember: a generator function contains one or more *yield* statements, instead of a *return* statement. Therefore, when a generator function is called, it returns an iterator object, that can be used to iterate through the items using the *next()* function or by simply looping over it.
