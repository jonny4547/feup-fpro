# 5. Odd Range

Write a **generator** function `odd_range(start, stop, step)` that *yields* the odd numbers between `start` and `stop` with a `step` increment between odd numbers.


Remember: a generator function contains one or more *yield* statements, instead of a *return* statement. Therefore, when a generator function is called, it returns an iterator object, that can be used to iterate through the items using the *next()* function or by simply looping over it.
