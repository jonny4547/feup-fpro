# 2. Comprehensions Party

Write a Python function `comprehensions(i, j)` that, given two integers `i` and `j`, returns a tuple with three components computed in the interval [`i`, `j`]:


1. A list with all numbers in that range that end in 3 or 8.
2. A tuple with the square root, rounded to 2 decimals, of numbers in that range.
3. A dictionary where the key is a number and the value is the corresponding character from the [ASCII table](http://www.asciitable.com/), of numbers in that range.


You cannot use cycles, only comprehensions.
