# Greatest common divisor

Write a recursive Python function `gcd_rec(n1, n2)` to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) using [Euclidean's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor#Euclid's_algorithm) of two integers `n1` and `n2`.


Using global variables or cycles is forbidden.
