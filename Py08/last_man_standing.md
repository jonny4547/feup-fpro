# Last Man Standing

In a circle of people, represented by a list of integers `alist`, a game will take place. Counting will start at the beginning of the list, and after counting a certain number of people, specified by `step`, the person where the counting stopped is out of the game.


Write a Python function `last_man_standing(alist, step)` that returns the last person left on the circle.


Using global variables or cycles is forbidden.
