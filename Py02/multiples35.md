# Multiples of 3 or 5

Define a function `sum_multiples(n)` that returns the sum of all the natural numbers that are a multiple of 3 or 5 up until `n` (inclusive).



```
def sum_multiples(n):
    # my code here
    return # FIXME

```

The sum of all natural numbers up to $$n$$ can be calculated using the formula:


$$$\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$$$


For example, the sum of all numbers up to $$5$$ is $$1+2+3+4+5=15$$, or using the formula:


$$$\frac{5(5+1)}{2}$$$
