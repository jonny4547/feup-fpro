# Weird Sum

Write a Python script that, given two integers `a` and `b`, prints the value of their sum.


* However, if the difference of `a` and `b` is an even number, the value of the sum is doubled.
* On the other hand, if the difference is an odd number, the value of the product of `a` and `b` gets added to the value of the sum.


Do **not** use conditionals (e.g., `if` or `while`).
