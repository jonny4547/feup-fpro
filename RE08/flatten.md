# 3. Flatten

Given a nested list `alist` (i.e., a list which may contain lists which themselves may contain other lists, and so on), write a recursive Python function `flatten(alist)` that returns a single list with each of the non-list elements, in order of occurrence. This process is known as list flattening.
