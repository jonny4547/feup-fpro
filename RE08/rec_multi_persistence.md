# 1. Recursive multiplicative persistence

Re-read the exercise [Multiplicative Persistence](https://fpro.fe.up.pt/test/pe01/multi_persistence) from PE01. Write a function called `rec_multiplicative_persistence(n)` that re-implements the iterative solution using simple recursion.


Feel free to adapt the [official solution](https://moodle.up.pt/enrol/index.php?id=1738) to recursion.
