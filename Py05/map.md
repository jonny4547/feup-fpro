# Find the treasure

The path to the treasure is given as a sequence of commands that are steps of length 1: *up*, *left*, *right* or *down*. Write a function `map(pos, steps)` that takes a coordinate `pos`, which is a tuple with values x and y as (x,y), and a sequence of commands in a string `steps`, with the steps separated by a hyphen, and computes the final position in the map.
