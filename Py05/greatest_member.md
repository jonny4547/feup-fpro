# Greatest Member

Define a function `greatest_member(a_tuple)` that given a tuple `a_tuple`, returns the member of the tuple who has the highest score; for tiebreakers return the member that appears first in the tuple.


The score is calculated by summing the ASCII code of each character for every string the member contains.


A member can be either a string or another tuple. In the second case, the total score of the member is the sum of all scores of each sub-member.


If the initial tuple has no members, return an empty tuple.
