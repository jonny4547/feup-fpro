# Rearranging

Write a function `rearrange(l)` that, given a list of numbers `l`, rearranges it so that all non-positive numbers appear before the positive ones, but does **not** alter the numbersâ€™ relative order (i.e., all positive numbers must appear in the same order relative to each other as in the original list; same goes for non-positive numbers).
