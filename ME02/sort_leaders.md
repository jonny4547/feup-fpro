# 4. Scores

Consider the *leaderboard*, given as a nested tuple of N tuples in the format *(name, (score\_1, score\_2, ...))*, with the names that tried one assessment and the score of each attempt.


Write a Python function `sort_leaders(records)` to sort the leaderboard records according to the following criteria:


1. Sort based on the maximum score (descending order);
2. Then sort based on the number of tries (ascending order);
3. Then sort based on student name (ascending order);


where *name* is a string and each *score* is an integer between 0 and 100.
