# Polynomials

Suppose we have a polynomial represented as a list of coefficients, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]`, where `a[i]` is the coefficient of `x**i`; that is: $$$f(x)=a\_0x^0+a\_1x^1+\dots+a\_nx^n$$$


Write a function `evaluate(a, x)` that evaluates the value of the polynomial for a given integer `x`.


You should use comprehensions.
