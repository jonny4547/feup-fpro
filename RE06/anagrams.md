# 5. Anagrams

Given a list of strings, write a Python function `anagrams(alist)` that groups anagrams together and returns them in a nested list. An *[anagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram)* is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase by using all the original letters exactly once.


Note that you can add and/or remove white spaces between the letters to form the anagrams (they are not relevant when evaluating if two words/phrases are anagrams of each other) and case is irrelevant.


The output list as well as its nested lists should be sorted alphabetically.
