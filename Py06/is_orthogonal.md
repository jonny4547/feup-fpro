# Orthogonal matrices

Write a function `is_orthogonal(mx)` that given a square matrix (list of lists where each list represents a row), determines if the matrix is orthogonal, returning the appropriate boolean value. A matrix M is orthogonal if MMáµ€ = I (i.e. the product of M by its transpose is equal to the identity matrix). The identity matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements of the principal diagonal are ones and all other elements are zeros.


* for the matrix `mx=[[-1, 0], [0,1]]`, the output should be `True`
* for the matrix `[[-2,3], [4,-1]]`, the output should be `False`
