# Fetching the middle

Write a Python function `fetch_middle(llists)` that, given a list of lists `llists`, returns a new list containing the middle element from each list in `llists`. If the list's length is even, consider the middle element to be the average between its two central elements (i.e. for the list [1, 2, 3, 4], the middle element would be (2+3)/2 = 2.5).
