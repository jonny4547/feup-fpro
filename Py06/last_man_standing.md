# Last Man Standing

In a circle of people, represented by a list `a_list`, a game will take place. Counting will start at the beginning of the list, and after counting a certain number of people, specified by `step`, the person where the counting stopped is out of the game.


Write a Python function `last_man_standing(a_list, step)` that returns the last person left on the circle.


Notice that `step` includes the person itself. For example, for `a_list = [3, 4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 7]` and `step = 3`, then the first person to be eliminated is `1`, then `5`, then `4`, then `7`, then `2`, then `3`, therefore `6` would survive.
